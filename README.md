# SizeMatters
This repository contains raw and processed data, code, the printout of the results and the supplementary notes for _Size Matters: towards a critical assessment of size-related effects in gender assignment_.
In the supplementary file, there are seven supplementary notes for the study. Notes One to Five present some additional discussion of the experimental procedures in the study. Notes One to Four discuss issues related to the experimental size annotation. Note Five is the discussion of translational issues in the study: in either experiment, after assessing size values of concepts, we map these concepts onto the translational equivalents in the languages of our study. Note Six contains some additional discussion of the peculiar results observed in Tsakhur, one of the languages of the sample. In the last Note, we provide the full printout of our Mann-Whitney test results.
